# Middle School Management App

## Description
A mobile app for students and teachers to keep their classes and clubs organized. Students will be notified about what they need for each day of their schedule, and if there is anything important going on in their classes or extra-curriculars. Teachers will be able to broadcast information for the classes and clubs they are in charged of, which will be received by students.
